User Experience (UX) is much bigger than User Interface (UI). Some people even use the term “Customer Experience” to further emphasize the point. UX is any way that customers and end-users realize the value provided by your product. It includes all the touchpoints and interactions a customer has with your company and product over time. For modern products, this usually includes multiple different UI’s (web, mobile, desktop, etc.) as well as other customer touch points (email, customer support, notification, online storage integration, etc.). With some products, UX also includes offline services like riding in a car summoned through Uber, or staying in a house sourced through AirBnB.

One of the most important tools of modern product teams are prototypes. Discovering products that customers love requires continuous collaboration with colleagues as well as frequent validation with external users and customers. Prototypes provide the vehicle to facilitate that communication. They are a far more accurate representation of intent than wireframes or screenshots as they are able to capture many other aspects of the full user experience.
